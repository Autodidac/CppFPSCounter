# CppFPSCounter

What I'm pretty certain is a working fundamental FPS implementation, works even in multithreaded environment (WIP - We'll keep an extra eye on this one)

I found a lot of not working ones, and queried many AI clients to solve this complex issue because I wasn't sure how many default frames to expect and I was getting very mixed results with very subtle changes in code. So I arrived at this in combination with technical queries and expectations I had from using other 3D Rendering engines, hopefully this helps the future figure it out. At any rate when I enevitably find other correct answers to this project I'll either include them or otherwise update the repo.
